              <p>
                Hello, my name is Georgina and I am a third year nursing student. This e-Portfolio is designed to keep my
                reflective pieces together, track progress such as Continuing Professional Development (CPD) and to prepare me
                for the daunting NMC revalidation in three years' time.
        </p>
              <p>
                Spending time in hospital as a child myself I can empathize with those in my care with how scary being in
                unwell can be. Aspiring to be a children's nurse I aim to gain the skill set (My Skills can be found in the
                sidebar) to work with family units to get children back home if they can after illness'.
        </p>
              <p>
                I am due to graduate from King's College London in July 2018 and receive my NMC Pin shortly after, I have
                secured a role at Evelina London Children's Hospital and will be allocated my ward soon. My dissertation
                subject is 'Asthma and Obesity Meta-analysis' and once finished and graded I will post snippets on this
                website.
        </p>
              <p>
                Below is a gallery of pictures of me and pictures from my adventures to keep you entertained amongst enormous
                collection of work on this site.
