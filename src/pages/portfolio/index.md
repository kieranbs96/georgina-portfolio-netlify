## Clinical Portfolio

This portfolio contains typed feedback I have received from my workplace and placements that I have been on as a student. My placements have been across three hospitals if you include my nursing elective. I have also taken part in two different community setting placements and a variety of simulated and multi-disciplinary learning days.
