### An event or experience in your professional practice

<react-collapsible trigger="1. Parent complaining about another member of staff – maintaining professionalism">

### 1. What was the nature of the event or experience in your practice?

Upon my neonatal placement in my third year I was looking after a newly admitted patient. The mother of this patient approached me in confidence crying suggesting the nurse in charge (NIC) had been ‘horrible’ to her. I gave her a hug and took her to the breastfeeding room as the only room free. We discussed what happened and the NIC had suggested she should be more organised and in the future eat herself before breastfeeding so she doesn’t have to rush off and she can express any remaining milk already stimulated in the breasts. The patient was three days old and the mother had recalled the NIC saying I understand you are hormonal being day three postnatal this is the hormonal peak for mothers.

From this I validated mum’s feelings and empathised her with her frustration of being told what to do and concluded through discussion that mum didn’t feel good enough for her child. I reassured mum that this was not the NICs’ intentions at all and perhaps her communication should have been a bit different to assert this. I spoke to the NIC in person who was not aware of her insensitivity and the NIC went and discussed what happened with the mother knowing how she interpreted their altercation earlier.

### 2. What did you learn from this?

I learnt that as a student I can still have professional conversations with staff about changing practice. As a student I can deal with emotional parents and de-escalate misunderstandings. I also learnt how communication led to a misunderstanding so easily.

### 3. How did you change or improve your practice as a result?

From this I will be careful with my own practice in how I phrase things so parents don’t feel like useless parents but I can communicate the knowledge I need to share and teach. Thinking before speaking whilst seems so obvious is something I have aimed to do more since starting my training. Instinctively there would be things I want to say to parents about their lifestyle, behaviour or choices but the appropriateness and tone of conversation needs to be correct to communicate an effective accurate message that is not misinterpreted.

### 4. How is this relevant to the Code<sup>[1]</sup> ?

7.1 use terms that people in your care, colleagues and the public can understand

7.3 use a range of verbal and non-verbal communication methods, and consider cultural sensitivities, to better understand and respond to people’s personal and health needs Nursing and Midwifery Council

7.5 be able to communicate clearly and effectively in English.

8.2 maintain effective communication with colleagues

24.1 never allow someone’s complaint to affect the care that is provided to them, and

24.2 use all complaints as a form of feedback and an opportunity for reflection and learning to improve practice

<react-collapsible trigger="2. Nasogastric (NG) feeding technique – making thorough checks and being prepared">

### 1. What was the nature of the event or experience in your practice?

At the start of my second year in training I was asked by my mentor to administer an NG feed to a patient I was unfamiliar with. It was 1700 hours and I had not had my lunch on a long day shift. I asked my mentor for details of the feed to which she said the bottle is there warmed up you just have to administer it. I aspirate the NG checked the pH and the nostril measurement. The nostril measurement was the same to the one documented when passed and pH was 4.0 therefore I commenced the feed. The parents asked if gaviscon was in the feed after 1ml had already been administered. I automatically stopped the feed apologiesd sincerely, and asked my mentor about the gaviscon to which we added the gaviscon to the feed and finished administering.

### 2. What did you learn from this?

Whilst a verbal handover of instructions delegated to me may seem clear, check what is documented as whilst the feed was ready, the additive of gaviscon was not which was very significant.
My second learning point being that flagging to my mentor I had not had a break could have mitigated the mistake as my concentration was lagging most likely with my BM, therefore looking after myself is just as important to look after others.

### 3. How did you change or improve your practice as a result?

Since, I have never fed following verbal instructions, I have always clarified documentation and checked with the parents they do not have additives, like gaviscon, infacol or thickeners. Therefore, I have covered all bases, verbal with colleagues, documentation and with parents. I exercised an extent of duty of candour here by admitting that the gaviscon had not been added and escalated the situation open and honestly so no harm was caused. An incident form and reflection was completed afterwards.

The system failures in my lack of supervision and poor communication on my mentors’ part were discussed to mitigate this happening to other students. Now I am more assertive with taking my breaks and remind anyone which contradicts my right to have a break that it effects my concentration and therefore patient safety.

### 4. How is this relevant to the Code <sup>[1]</sup> ?

14 Be open and candid with all service users about all aspects of care and treatment, including when any mistakes or harm have taken place

19.1 take measures to reduce as far as possible, the likelihood of mistakes, near misses, harm and the effect of harm if it takes place

19.2 take account of current evidence, knowledge and developments in reducing mistakes and the effect of them and the impact of human factors and system failures

<react-collapsible trigger="3. Management of a febrile convulsion in ED">

### 1. What was the nature of the event or experience in your practice?

A parent ran through the major’s ED doors with her 16month old child in her arms crying. Upon examination the child was having a convulsion with left sided limbs convulsing and his left eye rolled back. The child had a temperature of 39.9.c and the doctors diagnosed him with having a febrile convulsion. The ED nurses and I prepared buccal midazolam and administered it. Within 1 minute of administration the child stopped seizing.

### 2. What did you learn from this?

This was the first active febrile seizure I have seen and learnt that typically they only have one episode less than 5 minutes per illness and is most common under 5years old.  The best method to mitigate febrile convulsions is to treat high temperatures above 38.5.c regardless of discomfort. Some evidence suggests antipyretics should not be used if the fever is the only clinical abnormality, ie with no tachypnoea or tachycardia, however once above 38.5.c and under the age of 5 the treatment of fever is vital.

### 3. How did you change or improve your practice as a result?

Monitoring fever patients in the ED has become more vigilant in the under 5 age group. Therefore, even after an antipyretic is administered the rechecking of pyretic children is important.

### 4. How is this relevant to the Code <sup>[1]</sup> ?

6.2 maintain the knowledge and skills you need for safe and effective practice.

22.3 keep your knowledge and skills up to date, taking part in appropriate and regular learning and professional development activities that aim to maintain and develop your competence and improve your performance.

### A piece of practice-related feedback you have received

<react-collapsible trigger="1. De-escalating aggressive parents – maintaining professionalism">

### 1. What was the nature of the event or experience in your practice?

I observed my mentor insert a cannula in a child before her IVABs; the child was due gentamycin and usually had this at home by the outreach team, however she needed a gentamycin blood level. On examination the ante-cubical fossa (ACF) and back of hand was bruised. My mentor and another staff nurse were both taking their time before trying to insert a cannula as she clearly had bruises where prior cannula’s had been. Dad very quickly became inpatient and shouted; ‘just do it’, ‘the veins there I can see it’, ‘what’s taking so long?’, ‘that’s it I want someone who knows what they are doing to do it’, ‘give the needle here I’ll do it’. My mentor and the colleague present both told Dad to calm down, she is bruised and they need to concentrate to get the line in. Dad continued to escalate in aggression.

The doctor present in department came in and said that my mentor should take a break and come back when dad is less irate. My immediate thought was we need to call security as we have a no tolerance policy to violence and abusive language. Whilst my colleagues disagreed on calling security they continued for twenty minutes
trying to de-escalate dad by equally raising their voices and finally got a line in too.

### 2. What did you learn from this?

Upon reflection with colleagues at my university, we spoke about alternative perhaps more effective methods that could have been used. One option being, to use a whispering voice so dad is attentive of what you are saying and gradually he’ll bring his raised voice down to yours. Similarly, saying we have a zero tolerance policy I must ask you to leave the department if you continue to talk to me like this. There’s the option suggested by the SHO doctor in the department to leave him and say I’ll be back when you’ve calmed down. Finally, there is an option to put your equipment down and let dad rant and just listen to him, don’t respond or interrupt and eventually he’ll realise that he is the reason the procedure is taking so long, and that you can’t concentrate and listen to him shouting at the same time.

### 3. How did you change or improve your practice as a result?

Upon reflection I think I feel a little bit more confident in dealing with aggressive patients and their families and the variety of effective techniques that can be used. Seeing a scenario when perhaps de-escalation could have been done a different way and more effectively I can identify how not to handle an irate parent.

### 4. How is this relevant to the code <sup>[1]</sup>

20.5 treat people in a way that does not take advantage of their vulnerability or cause them upset or distress

20.6 stay objective and have clear professional boundaries at all times with people in your care (including those who have
been in your care in the past), their families and carers

20.7 make sure you do not express your personal beliefs (including political, religious or moral beliefs) to people in an
inappropriate way

20.8 act as a role model of professional behaviour for students and newly qualified nurses and midwives to aspire to
Nursing and Midwifery Council

20.10 use all forms of spoken, written and digital communication (including social media and networking sites) responsibly,

<react-collapsible trigger="2. Remaining supernumerary – behaving within your competencies">

### 1. What was the nature of the event or experience in your practice?

I was looking after a group of patients under supervision and one patient was due an oral medication. I mentioned it to my mentor twenty minutes before it was due, the five minutes before it was due. At the minutes before it was due she said she was too busy and I’d have to get another colleague to draw it up and administer the medication with me. I asked a colleague whom said give me ten minutes to this NG feed. I offered to do the feed for her and she declined that she’d rather do it. When she drew the medication up with me the medication was now thirty minutes late, the drug being administered was digoxin and she said it should never be given late. At which point I reiterate that as a student I cannot administer medication by myself. The medication was administered under supervision.

### 2. What did you learn from this?

I learn from this that when communicating it is good to give quantifiable facts about the priority. I didn’t press for it to be done urgently because I honestly believed when they said five minutes that it wouldn’t lead to ten twenty thirty minutes etc. I learned that if I am assertive whilst most wards are stretched with staff I should remain in my supernumerary status and act within my competencies. From this I got very flustered as I felt very guilty for administering the medication late. Whereas on reflection I see the systems failures in lack of supervision rather than my own personal failings, as I tried as hard as I could to get a member of staff to assist in administering and legally I needed supervision.

### 3. How did you change or improve your practice as a result?

Next time perhaps I will communicate which drug is due and the importance of it being on time, therefore they know how important I see the task I am asking for help with and get my needs met in the system with appropriate supervision.

### 4. How is this relevant to the code <sup>[1]</sup>

9.4 support students’ and colleagues’ learning to help them develop their professional competence and confidence.

13 Recognise and work within the limits of your competence

<react-collapsible trigger="3. Acting intuitively in a variety of settings – pre-empting resources and being on the ball.">

### 1. What was the nature of the event or experience in your practice?

In the A+E department a patient arrived complaining of diarrhoea and vomiting. Whilst my colleague triaged them I prepared an oral rehydration solution (ORS) after I asked a colleague to prescribe it and filled in their details for a fluid challenge chart. I took this into triage and assisted my colleague with observations and when it came to the end of their triage formalities the ORS was ready made and fluid challenge instructions present for them to take in waiting area and begin the fluid challenge promptly.

### 2. What did you learn from this?

From this I received very positive feedback from my colleagues that I used my initiative and was proactive, pre- empting the resources needed. This is something I will take forward to future placements and throughout my career. I appreciate that working as a team and working intuitively is situation dependent and if other priorities are existing they will come first.

### 3. How did you change or improve your practice as a result?

Here I used my confidence to act on my own initiative using my pre-existing knowledge of the trust procedures. By doing this the patient didn’t breach and was treated effectively in A+E.

### 4. How is this relevant to the code <sup>[1]</sup>

1.4 make sure that any treatment, assistance or care for which you are responsible is delivered without undue delay,

25.1 identify priorities, manage time, staff and resources effectively and deal with risk to make sure that the quality of care or
service you deliver is maintained and improved, putting the needs of those receiving care or services first,

### An instance of your CPD

<react-collapsible trigger="1. Use of DALYs and QALYs in healthcare">

### 1. What was the nature of the event or experience in your practice?

I attended a seminar based on Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and how these shape the funding each disease or condition is allocated in the NHS.  This gave me a whole new perspective on the way treatments for specific cases are prioritised and how cuts are made.

QALYs cannot be gained. Once the quality of life is lost there is no getting it back. Whereas with DALYs, DALYs can be gained. The DALY system operates by using a maximum age of 82.5 years old. The x-axis representing years and y- axis representing disability or quality of life depending if its QALY or DALY you are looking at. If a child was to lose a leg at five years old, in a developed country a shaded square in the top right corner would be shaded in, so they had no disability until the age of 5, and now they are let’s say 80% not disabled. But they can never get that amputated limb back so they remain at 80% until their 82.5 years on the axis. The shaded 20% from 5 years old is the cost to the government for the child only having one leg. If they child gets a prosthetic leg that costs less than his lifetime of not working because he only had one leg, the government could justify paying for this prosthetic. The DALY now increases from 80 to 95% and this means the child will live a pretty much normal life. This is often not the case.

For example, if the child lost their leg in the developing world then they wouldn’t have access to prosthetics, so the cost would have doubled to include flights and fittings etc. Perhaps a member of family has to stay at home to look after this child as he cannot go to school because he cannot commute. This put the family out of work affecting the parents QALYs which they cannot gain back. Whilst his prosthetic in the developed world is seen as a small hurdle to overcome it drastically affects the QALY of a life in the developing world.

Similarly, neonates are given every inch of funding possible because no matter how they save the neonate they have 82.5 years to contribute via tax to the economy and it is this life that is so precious. Whereas if someone died at 60 years old the healthcare costs mean that they cannot contribute 22.5 years via tax to the economy but they also are not burdening the system with NHS costs for the diseases they have.

The WHO determines DALYs and they allocate each condition a certain DALY and QALY and the condition of course has to be known and around long enough to assign a well-educated DALY and QALY. The risk of success in full recovery, resources used and guaranteed success elsewhere in the world is what determines the QALY and DALY.

But of course there are syndromes without a name (SWAN), that children are diagnosed with as last resort. What QALYs and DALYs are they allocated? And how can we predict what we do not know?

### 2. What did you learn from this?

I learnt that whilst some conditions are given more financial resources and support than others it is the WHO whom allocates DALYs and QALYs to try and numerically justify each pound spent. Whilst the system seems flawed from our perspective the decision makers perhaps think the reductionist QALY and DALY formula can help make the tough decisions that must be made with the finite resources the NHS has.

### 3. How did you change or improve your practice as a result?

I think I will share my knowledge about QALYs and DALYs with my peers to educate them on how budgets are made and accrued down to every condition or every decision about treatment. Sharing this makes me hopeful that a better most just system will come into place in the future.

<react-collapsible trigger="2. Brainstem death testing use and organ donation">

### 1. What was the nature of the event or experience in your practice?

I attended a seminar led by the local organ donation team to learn about brain stem death. They shared with me that 1 in 5 members of the public don’t think brain stem death exists despite it being by definition one of three causes of death, followed by cardiorespiratory and cellular.

### 2. What did you learn from this?

Increased ICP can cause coning or tonsiloherniation whereby the brain stem shifts down on to the spinal column. The brain stem has three important roles, homeostasis, sleep and alertness. When a child is a prolonged non responsive state the child must be observed for more time than it takes for the sedatives to be cleared from the system. If a child is brainstem death, once the machines are removed they will not breath leading to their heart stopping.

Whilst this is a distressing time for the family, transparency of what is occurring and objective measures that indicate brainstem death is vital. Clinicians should allow parents the opportunity to watch the brain stem testing whilst also making them aware of the reflexes that may appear to show signs of life which are just reflexes like sitting up. Every family should have organ donation discussed with them when there is a question about brain stem death.

### 3. How did you change or improve your practice as a result?

Having greater awareness around this topic, having not seen any prolonged deterioration it is useful to know the processes that must occur for legal brainstem death to be determined and how this can be translated to parents.

### 4. How is this relevant to the code<sup>[1]</sup>

5.5 share with people, their families and their carers, as far as the law allows, the information they want or need to know about their health, care and ongoing treatment sensitively and in a way they can understand.

7.3 use a range of verbal and non-verbal communication methods, and consider cultural sensitivities, to better understand and respond to people’s personal and health needs

<react-collapsible trigger="3. Use of hoists in the workplace – a reflection on mandatory training">

### 1. What was the nature of the event or experience in your practice?

I had my mandatory training update form moving and handling and recognised multiple learning points about hoists, that I needed a refresher on.

### 2. What did you learn from this?

Firstly, I learnt that the breaks should never be on unless it is being stored. This is because the hoist needs to find its own centre of gravity. The second point being to always check the battery is charged. Having been on a ward where I am the only colleague comfortable in using such a device it was very useful to have a refresher.

### 3. How did you change or improve your practice as a result?

Now i will check the battery before taking the hoist to my bed space and never put the brakes on unless storing it.
### 4. How is this relevant to the code<sup>[1]</sup>

6.1 make sure that any information or advice given is evidencebased, including information relating to using any healthcare products or services, and 6.2 maintain the knowledge and skills you need for safe and effective practice.
