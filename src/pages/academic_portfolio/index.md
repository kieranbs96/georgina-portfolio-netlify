### Discuss the role that the nurse has in the protection for those who are vulnerable or at risk from harm, neglect or abuse

60% - Nurses are responsible for protecting those who are vulnerable or at risk from harm, neglect or abuse as set out in The Code (NMC, 2015). To achieve this the nurse must be vigilant of behaviours and attentive to their patients (NICE, 2014) whilst considering predisposing factors the patients can face (Batley, 2013).  Discussion with colleagues should be on a “need-to-know” basis (NMC, 2015) and safeguarding children is not an opt-in responsibility. The only unacceptable action when escalating an at risk patient is ‘not acting’.

### Use a family centred approach to identify care needs of the patient and family
