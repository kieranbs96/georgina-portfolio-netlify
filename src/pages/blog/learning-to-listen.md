  Whilst hearing is one of our five senses, listening is not an integral skill that most of us possess. I can be guilty of this myself. Therefore, in this month’s AOTM I will be discussing the two article series in the Nursing Times about how to listen and reflect on this in relation to practice.

The article in question this month highlights listening as one of the assumed skills among healthcare professionals comparing it to hand hygiene<sup>[1]</sup>. Currently, I am in my final year of training for Children’s Nursing and whilst this article is aimed at nurse revalidating, I can reflect on my own communication.

When a patient or family member asks for an update or to speak to the doctor, I tend not to get the specifics or ask them what they are worried about. I think whilst I have had SAGE and THYME training<sup>[2]</sup> I have interpreted its use only in the context of a distressed or crying individual. Subtle anxiety cues didn’t come to mind when doing the training and this article reiterates that, you can take five minutes to sit next to a patient and get to the bottom of what they are worrying about.

My next learning point from this article is how natural and fluid the SAGE and THYME model can be used. I think when I had my training I was unsure to how each question flows to one another and this example in this article completely demonstrates that. I can see with practice how natural this approach will become.

The article made me think about problem solving versus listening too. And I think in a busy ward environment nurses want to fix everyone’s problems and come up with solutions, I certainly do. I think the SAGE and THYME model really lets you as a human being have a mental break that slows the day down and allows you to build professional rapport with patients and only providing solutions right at the end.
