title: Amniotic Band Syndrome (ABS)

description: >-
  The rare condition that develops in utero results in a variety of different
  deformities in those that have ABS. ABS occurs when thick amniotic bands
  constrict around limbs or extremities, some causing constriction and some
  causing complete amputation.

Before I had seen a patient who had amniotic band constriction related amputations I had never heard of amniotic band constriction. The particular patient I had seen I didn't notice the deformity immediately until I tried placing a pulse oximeter on her fingers and saw that all her fingers and toes were amputated. I looked puzzled at mum and said was she born like this and she said "yes, she has ABS".

Having looked into this condition <sup>[1]</sup>, I realised that thick amniotic bands can sometimes wrap around the foetus in utero. This can cause loss of extremities like in this case but can result in still births and miscarriage if the band is around the neck. I also learnt that it is as cause of some very common deformities such as cleft lip and palette and club footing.

For ABS to occur part of the uterus membrane has to rupture, leading me to think that perhaps pregrancy lifestyle such as smoking drinking or heavy exercise may predispose the foetus to ABS. This is however not the case and ABS has not been linked to any pregnancy factors and occurs randomly <sup>[2]</sup>.
