She made me confident while I was in hospital. I was very happy when she gave me Lego to take my mind off the pain. Nothing really [she could improve on] she is amazing.

Georgina is confident in her abilities, takes charge and uses her initiative, but stays within the remit and does not exceed her skills and knowledge base. She asks questions appropriately to make informed decisions. She prioritises tasks appropriately and is great help on the ward. She maintains professionalism and interacts well with patients and staff. Overall a good student en-route to being a great nurse

Georgina successfully passed an NG tube on a 2-year old child. She could give a rationale based on evidence when questioned about passing the tube and explained to dad what she was doing and answered his questions. Georgina wrote clear written notes and kept up to date written documentation. She communicated effectively with her patients and included them in decision making about their care

 Georgina and I have worked together on a day shift. Georgina has interacted well with patients and their families and has been very helpful, showing initiative making beds, completing bedside checklists and recording observations under supervision. She has also practiced basic drug calculations and observed BM recordings. Thanks for all your help today!
